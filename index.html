			<p> Located just outside of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, 
				Paradise Mountain Family Resort is the perfect getaway place for the 
				whole family. Adults can enjoy discounted golf and complimentary use 
				of our health club and tennis facilities while the little ones 
				participate in our popular childrenâ€™s program. </p>
				
			<p> Friday night dances are always a hit with the teens, and our new 
				skate park offers one of the finest courses designed to entertain and 
				challenge skaters, whether they are beginners or more experienced. </p>
	
			<p>	Hiking is a must-do activity in the beautiful Rocky Mountains. Guests can 
				participate in one of our wilderness treks (designed for both experienced 
				and beginning hikers), or strike out on their own for a more intimate 
				wilderness experience. </p>

			<p>	In addition to hiking activities, during the summer months guests can 
				enjoy horseback riding, white-water rafting, or fly fishing for trout 
				in one of our many private streams. Rodeo fans arriving in mid-July will 
				be sure to catch some of the events at the annual PRCA Rooftop Rodeo at 
				the nearby Stanley Park Fairgrounds. </p>
			
			
			<p>	Wintertime guests are sure to enjoy a snowshoe trek along our 
				well-manicured trails, a brisk downhill ski run, or the comfort 
				of a cozy fire in our rustic ski lodge. </p>
